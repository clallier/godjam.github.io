# The Nature Of Code 
by Daniel Shiffman

## About this project
This is a translation of "The Nature Of Code" book in vanilla Javascript.

I start this as a "toy" project during last holidays.
My goal was to deepen my knowledge of JS / Canvas / creative coding.

It'a a project "Ã  la cool". I start it without internet (holidays, remember?) so there is no stuff about node nor other internet based dependences resolution.

Godjam.
